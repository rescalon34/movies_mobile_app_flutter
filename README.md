A small flutter project to show movies from a watchlist.

## Project Overview #####
The **MoviesMobileApp**! project is a basic app developed in Flutter. It aims to show movies from a watchlist, demonstrate the usage of some Flutter technologies like GoRouter, TypeSafeGoRouter, Bloc, etc. As this is a basic project, there are some features that are not yet completed, however it has pretty good amount of techs to play around with.

## Features
- A splash screen to decide where to navigate next depending on the user session.
- A login screen to "mock" a real login feature.
- Display some empty screens to allow navigation between different subflows.
- Display a list of Watchlist movies with the ability to see the details of a movie after tapping on it.
- A profile screen that only shows static content with the ability to "mock" a logout session.

## Technical overview.
This project is built using the Flutter framework in conbination with some third party flutter libs to handle Networking API calls. 
The [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API provides the watchlist movies data that is displayed on the App.

## Technical stack.
- DIO + Retrofit for networking API calls.
- getIt for DI.
- intl for localization and date formatting.
- GoRouter + TypeSafeGoRouter for navigation.
- SharedPreferences to store flags and non-sensitive data within the app.
- Repository pattern + Clean Architecture.
- Bloc for state management.
- Material3
- Adaptive Icons (Depending on the platform, the icons are adapted to their corresponding "look and feel").
- Montserrat font family.
